# MPD-Jesse-Lite
Installation of MPD onto Jesse Lite

I have been playing around with Archphile. It is a good setup and stable.

I am targeting using a Raspberry Pi 2 in my car with a 10 inch screen. 
Originally thinking of using two Pi's, one for Archphile and one for everything else. However I found the speed of the 2 
is adequate to run everything and the eventual communication between the two was becoming awkward.

However, when trying to make it all play together, I found Archphile had some limitations in what other packages I could even install.
I am replicating the base of the Archphile setup onto Raspbian Jesse Lite, utilising standard packages as much as possible, but 
keeping it to the minimum to do the job.

As with Archphile, it is running the following

  MPD
  MPC
  YMPD
  Mongoose for cover art
