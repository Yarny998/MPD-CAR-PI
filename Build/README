Expand the partition size
    https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=112253

    Delete the partition root is currently running on with fdisk
    Create a new partition using all defaults, but check the end of the remaining partition
        If the image was not written to the start of the card, it may pick up a very small partition.
        If this is the case, start the new partition 1 sector after the end of the remaining partition.
    Double check and write the partition
    Reboot
    Confirm the new partition name
      fdisk –l
    Resize (using the new partition)
      resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
    Check New Size
      df –h
