This is a setup for a 4 wire touchscreen with a controller such as the AR1100. Instructions are found at the site below:
http://engineering-diy.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/adding-7inch-display-with-touchscreen.html

Once the touchscreen is connected and setup.sh has been run, run the Xinput_calibrator program in an x-window.
This will give specific output for the screen.

Eg
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier    "calibration"
    MatchProduct    "eGalax Inc. USB TouchController"
    Option    "Calibration"    "121 1917 317 1741"
    Option    "SwapAxes"    "1"
EndSection

cd /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
check a similar device is not listed in other files, as this will confuse the system

Copy section above into /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-input.conf
    vi /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-input.conf
    paste in section

You may also find it helpful to add 3rd button emulation

In the same file above, paste in 
    Option "EmulateThirdButton" "1"
    Option "EmulateThirdButtonTimeout" "750"
    Option "EmulateThirdButtonMoveThreshold" "30"
