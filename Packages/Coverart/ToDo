1. Look into reduced brightness, or not displaying bright images, after dusk
On a vehicle centre console monitor, a bright image at night, either background or cover art, will be blinding.
Would like to check brightness and either reduce brightness of the image or simply display something else if too bright.

2. Annotate image instead of a popup.
When MPD is playing a track or paused, add the Artist, Album and Track to the coverart or background image, instead of a popup.
