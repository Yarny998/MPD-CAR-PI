This copies in a number of hidef backgrounds designed for a 1920x1200 screen

When MPD is playing and there is good albumart, the album art will be set as the background
If there is no albumart, random selections of the hidef backgrounds are used. These are rotated.

When MPD is not playing, the hidef backgrounds are rotated.

When MPD is paused, a pause background is used.

A popup shows the playing song info every now and then.
