This is a script to download and run i2select

Raspberry Pi 2
Jessie Lite
Audio card
MPD package

I2Select is a package from ArchPhile.
http://archphile.org
It has a Arch installer, but not for Debian
This script replicates the installer for Debian for now

I2Select helps setup some options for different audio cards attached to the Raspberry Pi

The mpd.conf is ignored from i2select however. This is a specific setup from this project so is not used.

copy down the i2select.sh file
run as root with no options
