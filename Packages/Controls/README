Button control
    The following uses a C program to control button presses from a button connected to GPIOs
    There are 4 configurable commands
    
    Usage
	      Press 1, 2 or 3 times within 1 second
	          1 press = next song
	          2 presses = previous song
	          3 presses = toggle play/pause

	          Hold down for more than 1 second
	          Not yet defined, perhaps shutdown the system

    Configuration
        /etc/buttons.conf

    Pins
        The script assumes one side of the switch/button is connected on pin 17
        The other side is connected on any of the GND pins
