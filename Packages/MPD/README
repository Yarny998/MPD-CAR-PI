This is the conf file for MPD for this build

Raspberry Pi 2
Jessie Lite
Alsaequal
IQAudio DAC+

NOTE This configuration file is very specific to this build, particularly the sound setup 
around alsaequal. You will most likely not get any sound with this configuration without also 
installing the alsaequal part as well.

If worst comes to worst, there is a clean fresh install mpd.conf in the repo called mpd.conf.std
